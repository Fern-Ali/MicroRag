MicroRag is a lightweight FastAPI-based system for inferencing Large Language Models (LLMs) and other machine learning models. It's paired with **Agent Kitty**, a Discord bot that interacts with the API to provide seamless responses to user queries. Together, MicroRag and Agent Kitty bring the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to a user-friendly platform.
