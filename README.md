MicroRag is a lightweight FastAPI-based system for inferencing Large Language Models (LLMs) and other machine learning models. It's paired with **Agent Kitty**, a Discord bot that interacts with the API to provide seamless responses to user queries. Together, MicroRag and Agent Kitty bring the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to a user-friendly platform.

### :sparkles: RAG Commands  
These commands allow for **document retrieval and LLM-powered responses**.

- **`!rag`**  
  Uploads a document to Djangoâ€™s backend, triggering the **RAG pipeline** for indexing.  
  - **Supported Formats:** `.pdf`, `.py`, `.ipynb`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.txt`  
  - **Example:** Attach a file and type `!rag`

- **`!rag_query [query]`**  
  Searches stored documents in **Qdrant** and returns **relevant text chunks**.  
  - **Example:** `!rag_query How does alpha-beta pruning selection work?`  
  - Creates a dedicated **Discord thread** for responses.  
  - Splits long chunks into multiple messages, labeled **Part 1, Part 2, etc.**  

- **`!query [query]`**  
  Sends the query to the **LLM directly** after retrieving documents Qdrant and passing them as context.  
  - **Example:** `!query Explain reinforcement learning`  
  - The bot **indicates typing** while processing the request.  
  - Creates a **Discord thread** for responses.
